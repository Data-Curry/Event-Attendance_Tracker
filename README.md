# Event-Attendance_Tracker
This project keeps a roster of people, a list of events / dates, and keeps track of which people attended which event.
It has a GUI using the Tkinter library, and stores information in a database file using sqlite3 and PostgreSQL.
The main menu options are to register people and events, and those people's attendance at those events.
The Main menu view options are to view all events a person has attended, view all events by ID, view all events chronologically.
View windows are scrollable.
